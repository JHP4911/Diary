# DICTIONARY

A dictionary is a book or electronic resource that lists the words of a language (typically in alphabetical order) and gives their meaning, or gives the equivalent words in a different language, often also providing information about pronunciation, origin, and usage.

This mini-project aim to create a dictionary in Python which can retrieve definitions for user and ask 'did you mean this instead?' if user made a typo while entering the word, and if the word has more than one definition then retrieve them all.
